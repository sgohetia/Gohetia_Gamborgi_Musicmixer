The focus of this project is to collaboratively research, experiment with and ultimately design and build a multimedia application using
design and motion tools as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The team will implement drag and drop functionality to load audio clips
and create a dynamic audio experience, trigger animation, and play a compiled audio track.

## Additional Features

Added a Mini Player page which you can listen music directly without dragging items.

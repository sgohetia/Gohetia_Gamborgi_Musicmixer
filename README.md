## Assignment History

### Description
The focus of this project is to collaboratively research, experiment with and ultimately design and build a multimedia application using design and moDon tools as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Your team will implement drag and drop functionality to load audio clips and create a dynamic audio experience, trigger animaDon, and play a compiled audio track (see www.incredibox.com as a reference). Try to implement this project in sprints - part of an agile workflow best practice. A sprint consists of a scoped mini-project that focuses on one particular deliverable or feature. The work you do lives on a specific branch; everything required to complete that deliverable is done on that branch and then merged to the main branch when finished. 

### Assignment Requirements
Sprint 1: Setup, analysis and iniDal design Set up the Github repo with a readme (make sure this is more than just the project name - refer to readme examples online). BOTH team members should be contributing at this point - the designer can create the layout, generate the html and the css; the developer should be researching functionality, creating JavaScript files, updating the HTML to add classes or other tools you might need to make things work. Testing events, loading audio, etc can all happen here - it doesn’t have to be final/finished but you should have an idea of how you want things to work, how you want it to look and start designing, testing and experimenting. 

IMPORTANT - designers MUST contribute to the repository directly, on their own design branch. You MAY NOT deliver design work via social media, or your partner’s commits, or deviate from the workflow best practices in any way. Create your artwork, add and commit it via Github. Failure to follow the correct workflow as outlined in the Authoring class will result in a (substanDal) grade reduction. 

Sprint 2: Drag and drop, audio, design improvements Implement drag and drop functionality; get your audio synced and playback working. Designers should be replacing any FPO (for position only) assets with real artwork and doing any other design changes that need to be finished. 

Sprint 3: Final touches / improvements At this point you should be crushing any final bugs that pop up, doing any final design tweaks, 

### Submission Requirements and Due date
Project must be submited within Week 12 class Dme: ONLY THE MAIN BRANCH WILL BE GRADED.NOT ZIPPED FILES! 
- Github repo: readme.md file, master branch, design branch and development branch
- correct structure for a web project (css, js, images, audio etc and index.html)
- DO NOT INCLUDE AI OR PSD FILES - just the SVGs / .png / .jpg in the image folder will do.
- Name the dev branches appropriately per feature IE des.tvr.artwork, dev.tvr.script
